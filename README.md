🚖 Uber Trips Analysis – Power BI Dashboard
Welcome to my Uber Trips Analysis project! This project showcases a detailed exploration of Uber ride data using Power BI, with the goal of uncovering insights that drive operational and strategic decision-making for a rideshare business.

📊 Project Overview
This dashboard replicates and expands upon analyses from two YouTube tutorials:
[Power BI Uber Dashboard – Part 1]
[Power BI Uber Dashboard – Part 2]
The report includes insights around:
- Demand patterns by time (hour, weekday, month)
- Trip distribution across geographic zones
- Ride volume and performance by vehicle type

📌 Business Context
As a Supply Chain/Data Analyst, I approached this dashboard as if presenting to a Supply Chain Director or Operations Manager at Uber. The key objective was to derive actionable insights for improving resource allocation, operational efficiency, and customer experience.

🔍 Key Insights
-Peak Hours: Highest demand occurs between 5 PM–8 PM, especially on weekends.
-Zone Concentration: Majority of trips occur in central zones like Midtown and Financial District.
-Vehicle Preferences: UberX dominates ride volume, while premium vehicles show potential for targeted upsell strategies.

🛠️ Tools Used
-Power BI Desktop
-DAX
-Custom visuals and formatting
-Geospatial mapping (Power BI Maps)

📁 Files Included

- `Uber_Trips_Analysis_Dashboard.pdf` – Exported dashboard for easy viewing
- `Uber_Trips_Analysis_Presentation_MariamAbdulazeez.pptx` – PowerPoint summary for executive presentation
- `README.md` – Project description and documentation

🎯 Recommendations

Based on this analysis, I proposed:
- Aligning driver shifts with time-based demand trends
- Rebalancing vehicles geographically to reduce wait times
- Promoting premium services in zones with matching rider demographics
